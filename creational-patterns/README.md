# Creational Design Patterns in Python

Practical implementation of creational design patterns using web development components.

## Patterns Implemented

### 1. Singleton Pattern
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Use Cases:**
- Database connection pools
- Logger instances
- Configuration managers

### 2. Factory Method Pattern
Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Use Cases:**
- Authentication strategies (JWT, OAuth, Basic)
- Payment processors (Stripe, PayPal, Bank Transfer)

### 3. Abstract Factory Pattern
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Use Cases:**
- Database connectors (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- Notification systems (Email, SMS, Push)

### 4. Builder Pattern
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

**Use Cases:**
- User profile creation
- Complex query construction

### 5. Prototype Pattern
Creates new objects by copying an existing object, rather than creating new instances.

**Use Cases:**
- Subscription plans cloning
- UI components templating

## Implementation Examples

Each pattern is implemented with practical web development components:
- Authentication systems
- Database connections
- Logging mechanisms
- User management
- Subscription services
